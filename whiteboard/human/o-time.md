======
O(1) - , commonly referred to as constant running time. An algorithm with constant running time always takes the same amount of time
to execute, regardless of the input size. This is the ideal run time for an algorithm, but it’s rarely achievable.

O(log n) — An algorithm is said to be logarithmic if its running time increases logarithmi- cally in proportion to the input size.
O(n) — A linear algorithm’s running time increases in direct proportion to the input size.
O(n log n) — A superlinear algorithm is midway between a linear algorithm and a polynomial algorithm.
O(n^c) — A polynomial algorithm grows quickly based on the size of the input.
O(c^n) — An exponential algorithm grows even faster than a polynomial algorithm.
O(n!) — A factorial algorithm grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even small values of n.

Finding an algorithm that works in superlinear time or better can make a huge difference in how well an application performs.

If you’re a C++ expert, though don’t be surprised if you’re asked how much memory a struct or class requires — the interviewer may want to check that you understand memory alignment and structure packing issues.
